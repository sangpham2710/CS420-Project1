## Search algorithms for each level

To run the search algorithms, goes into main.ipynb notebook and run all of the cells before the "Runner" section.
Then, use the "Runner" section to run the search algorithms for each level.

You can change the test case by changing the file, for example:

```python
grid = map_input("tests/level4/test10.txt")
```

Here, the test case is "tests/level4/test10.txt". You can change it to any test case you want.

## Map Design tool

To run the map design, run the following command:

```bash
python map_design.py
```
